# FlagCo Generator - Secure Web Implementation

A secure implementation of a flag generation web application. This project demonstrates secure input handling, XSS prevention, and proper web security practices.

## Features

- Input sanitization and validation
- XSS attack prevention
- Responsive design
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Secure text processing

## Security Features

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user input is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks by escaping HTML special characters
2. **Input Validation**: Empty or invalid inputs are handled gracefully
3. **Safe Output Handling**: Uses `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` to prevent script injection
4. **Input Length Restriction**: Maximum input length is enforced to prevent buffer overflow attempts
5. **No External Dependencies**: Minimizes attack surface by avoiding external libraries

## Quick Start

2. Start the development server using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Production Security Considerations

When deploying to production, consider implementing these additional security measures:

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Security Headers**: Add the following headers:
   - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF tokens for any form submissions
5. **Input Validation on Server**: Add server-side validation if adding a backend

## Development Server Security Note

The Python development server (`python3 -m http.server`) is intended for testing only. It:
- Should only be used for local development
- Should not be exposed to the public internet
- Does not include security features needed for production
- Should be accessed only from localhost

For production, use a proper web server like Nginx or Apache with appropriate security configurations.

## Usage

1. Enter your desired text in the input field
2. Click "Generate Flag using AI and Algorithms"
3. View the generated flag output
